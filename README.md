# SQL-Data-Analysis-Project-Zomato-SQL-Project

Project Overview
This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of my proficiency in SQL and data-driven problem-solving by analyzing a dataset inspired by Zomato, a leading food delivery platform in India. The objective is to showcase the application of SQL in real-world business scenarios through the end-to-end management of a relational database system. The project spans the complete lifecycleâ€”from setting up the database environment to formulating and executing complex queries that solve practical business challenges.

Project Structure
1. Database Setup
The project begins with the creation of a dedicated relational database named zonato_db. Within this database, multiple interrelated tables are defined to accurately represent different entities such as customers, restaurants, orders, menus, and delivery partners.

2. Data Import
Following the schema definition, sample data relevant to each table is inserted to simulate real-world operations. This step ensures that the dataset is sufficiently rich and diverse to support a variety of analytical use cases.

3. Data Cleaning
To maintain data integrity and ensure accurate analysis, null values and inconsistencies in the data are identified and addressed. Appropriate data cleaning techniques are applied to ensure that all tables are reliable and query-ready.

4. Business Problem Solving Using SQL
The core of the project involves addressing 16 distinct business problems that mimic real operational and strategic challenges faced by food delivery platforms. These problems range from identifying high-performing restaurants and analyzing customer behavior to optimizing delivery performance and revenue generation. Each problem is solved through the implementation of advanced SQL queries involving joins, subqueries, aggregations, window functions, and conditional logic.
